        <h2 class="title">Kanchipuram idli recipe</h2>
        <p>Kanchipuram idli recipe, a unique steamed rice cake that has a distinct flavor of dried ginger, cumin, and
            peppercorns</p>
        <p>One of my favorite idli variety that I must eat on every visit to Kanchi. Whenever we go for Lord Balaji’s
            darshan at Tirupati, we visit Kanchi too. Other than silk sarees, Kancheepuram is famous for its temples,
            Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham and of course the food. One of the most traditional Tamil tiffins or special food is
            Kancheepuram idli.

            This steamed delicacy is offered as prasadam at Sri Varadaraja Perumal temple. The food cooked in the temple
            kitchens and offered as prasadam to the Almighty has a flavor that cannot be replicated at home. Temple food
            is sacred with pure, clean flavors. Sattvik food at its best! One such temple food or koil neivedhyam is the
            Kanchipuram idli which also goes by the name kovil idli (temple idli), kudalai idli and tumbler idli.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">How to achieve the authentic, unique flavor of kanchipuram idli</h2>
        <p>Basically, raw rice, parboiled rice, and whole, skinned urad dal (black gram) are used in equal proportions.
            The rice (raw rice and parboiled rice) and urad dal are soaked in water separately for 5 to 6 hours. The
            rice has to be ground to a coarse texture (similar to semolina/sand) while the urad dal is ground to a
            smooth paste. Both of these batters are mixed together and the consistency of the batter should be neither
            thin nor thick.</p>
        <p>The authentic Kanjeevaram idli recipe does not call for tempering with mustard seeds and Bengal gram. We add
            coarsely crushed cumin seeds, peppercorns, and dried ginger powder (sukku podi/sonti podi) to the fermented
            idli batter along with ghee, gingelly oil, asafoetida, curry leaves and salt. But you can add a tempering of
            mustard seeds and chana dal also. I like to add broken pieces of cashew nuts that have been roasted in ghee.

            Traditionally, Kanjivaram idlis are steamed in dried ‘mantharai’ (kachanar/pulichinta/camel’s foot tree)
            leaf cups which lend a unique flavor to the idli. You can use banana leaves too.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Method for making Kanchipuram idli recipe</h2>

        <p>Soak raw rice and parboiled rice in water for atleast 5 hours. Grind the rice to a coarse consistency
            (similar to rava/sand), remove and set aside. Grind the urad dal to a smooth paste. Mix both the rice and
            urad dal paste thoroughly.

            Place lid and set aside to ferment for at least 8 hours. The idli batter should turn sour.

            At the time of preparing Kanchipuram idli, heat ghee in a small pan and add the broken cashewnuts and saute
            till golden brown. Add the roasted cashew nuts along with the ghee to the batter.

            Coarsely crush the cumin seeds and black peppercorns.

            In the same pan, add gingelly oil, Once hot, add crushed cumin seeds and black peppercorns, asafoetida and
            curry leaves. Immediately, add this tempering to the idli batter.

            Next, sprinkle dried ginger powder and salt and mix to combine well. The idli batter is ready now.

            Pour some water into the steamer/pressure cooker. While the water is heating, grease the mantharai leaf cups
            with gingelly oil. Pour batter till half full and place on a flat plate or place in the groove of each idli
            mold. If using banana leaf, line a round cake tin with a banana leaf, grease it and pour idli batter till it
            is half full.

            Place in the steamer, place lid and steam on medium high heat for 15 to 18 mins or till done. The cake tin
            will take a longer time to cook (25 mins) than the mantharai cups.

            Remove the steamed idlis and de-mold from the cups and serve with kara chutney or any chutney of your
            choice.</p>

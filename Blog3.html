        <p>Masala poori with potato curry, a tasty breakfast food made with whole wheat flour, Indian spice powders like
            turmeric and red chilli powder.</p>
        <p>A weekend vegetarian breakfast special in our home during the winter months is masala poori with potato
            curry. Summer is upon us and I rarely cook deep fried food. Over the weekend, my son asked me to make pooris
            for breakfast and I obliged him by making poori with a twist. I made a spicy version of the regular poori
            which calls for the addition of Indian spices like turmeric powder and red chilli powder to whole wheat
            flour dough mixture.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Tips to follow while making masala poori recipe</h2>
        <p>The common ingredients in most masala poori variants are turmeric powder. red chilli powder and carom seeds
            aka ajwain. I like to add Kasuri methi aka dried fenugreek leaves and asafoetida to pep it up a bit. If you
            decide to use Kasuri methi, I’d suggest you add a little sugar to the dough to cut down the bitterness of
            the dried leaves. You can add green chilli paste instead of red chilli powder. Puris should be puffed up and
            remain like a balloon till you decide to deflate it. If you add semolina and hot oil to the whole wheat
            flour while making the dough, you will achieve puffed up, crisp puris. Since masala poori is heavy breakfast
            food, asafoetida and carom seeds help in easy digestion. Ensure that you roll out the poori dough into a
            thick round of 1/4″ thickness, slightly thicker than you would roll out for preparing pulka or chapati. The
            poori dough should not be sticky but smooth and slightly stiffer than normal chapati dough.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Method for making Masala Poori Recipe</h2>

        <p>In a wide bowl, place whole wheat flour, chickpea flour, semolina, carom seeds, turmeric powder, red chilli
            powder, coriander powder, asafoetida, kasoori methi, sugar and salt.

            Add hot oil and mix well into the flour mixture. Slowly add water to form a slightly firm dough.

            Cover and allow to sit for at least 20 minutes.

            Now divide the kneaded poori dough into approx 15 portions. Shape them into round balls. Coat the working
            surface as well as the rolling pin with a little oil. Coat each ball with a little oil (do not dust with
            flour) and roll into a flat 4" round shape with 1/4" thickness.

            Heat oil in a heavy bottomed vessel or kadhai till hot. If you place a small piece of dough in the oil, it
            should sizzle up. Reduce heat to medium and place a rolled puri into the oil and with very gentle pressure
            press with the back of a slotted ladle till it puffs up.

            Flip over the poori and allow to cook for a few seconds till it attains a light golden shade. Place the
            poori over an absorbent paper towel to absorb excess oil.

            Prepare pooris with the rest of the balls and serve warm with potato masala, aloo bhaji, pickle or any curry
            of your choice.</p>

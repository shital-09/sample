        <h2 class="title">Dhokla recipe</h2>
        <p>Dhokla recipe is a tasty, healthy, vegan, steamed snack from Gujarat made with chickpea flour (besan) and
            tempering of Indian spices</p>
        <p>Dhokla recipe is very easy to make using minimal, everyday ingredients which include chickpea flour, yoghurt
            and
            Indian spices. This savoury, steamed vegetarian snack is from the state of Gujarat. It wouldn’t be an
            exaggeration to categorise it as one of the healthiest and tasty snacks of India. Also known as khaman
            dhokla,
            it is a very popular street food throughout the country though it has its origins in the western part of
            India.
            Dhokla owes its popularity to an addictive flavour, visual appeal and health quotient. Low calorie and
            nutritious, it is light on the stomach yet filling. You can serve this power packed dhokla for breakfast,
            brunch, snack or dinner. With Holi around the corner, dhokla would make an apt festive breakfast food.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Dhokla recipe – tips to make soft & spongy dhokla in cooker</h2>
        <p>The dhokla batter is a perfect blend of chickpea flour, sour yoghurt or curd, water, oil, ginger green chilli
            paste, asafoetida, turmeric powder, salt and Eno fruit salt. The most important thing while making the
            batter is
            to make the batter smooth, creamy and pourable similar to pancake batter. Ensure there are no lumps in the
            batter. I’d suggest you sieve the chickpea flour or besan, beat the batter for at least 2 minutes in one
            direction to allow aeration and make it lump free.</p>
        <p>Eno fruit salt and citric acid should be mixed into the beaten dhokla batter just before it is placed in the
            cooker or steamer. You can use a steamer or place the prepared batter in a pressure cooker without using the
            weight. While you are preparing the batter, heat the steamer or cooker with water. You should be able to
            place
            the prepared batter in a steamer which is hot and letting out steam. This helps in even cooking and rising
            of
            dhokla batter yielding a soft and spongy dhokla.</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Method for making Dhokla Recipe</h2>

        <p>Heat the cooker or water with 2 cups water. While the steam is building up in the cooker/steamer, prepare the
            dhokla batter.

            Grease a stainless steel round vessel or aluminium cake tin and set aside.

            In a wide bowl, add the sieved chickpea flour, semolina, salt, turmeric powder, asafoetida, green
            chilli-ginger paste and oil. Mix well. Add yoghurt and mix to form a thick mixture. Slowly adding water, a
            little at a time, to form a smooth, thick, pouring consistency batter.

            Beat the batter in one direction for 2 minutes. Mix a tsp of water in Eno salt and citric acid and mix and
            immediately add to the batter and mix with a light hand. It will increase in volume and become frothy.

            Immediately pour this batter into the greased tin and place in the cooker or steamer. Place lid and steam on
            a medium flame for 12 to 14 minutes.

            Check with a toothpick by pricking in the centre of the dhokla. If it comes out clean, the dhokla is cooked.
            Turn off heat, remove the vessel from the cooker and cool slightly.

            In a pan, add water and sugar and bring to a boil. Turn off the flame. Add lemon juice and mix well. Pour
            this over the dhokla.

            Heat oil in a small pan for tempering. Once hot, add mustard seeds and allow to splutter. Add cumin seeds,
            sesame seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves and roast for a few seconds.

            Pour this tempering all over the dhokla. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and grated fresh coconut. Let
            the dhokla rest for at least 20 minutes for the flavours to be absorbed.

            Only after the dhokla has cooled down completely, cut into square pieces and place on a serving tray. Serve
            with green chutney or tomato ketchup.</p>
